The Warehouse plugin will implement the following functionality:

-mark chests to be part of a Warehouse by putting a sign on them.
The contents of the sign describe what items the chest will deliver from the supply pool.

-interact with the sign/chest in some way to refill the chests contents from the Warehouse.

-mark chest to be a dropoff point that players can use to offload items to the Warehouse, by putting them into the chest.

-requirement: the Warehouse can only deliver goods that were previously dropped off by players into the dropoff-chest.
The warehouse is not allowed to create new items or remove existing ones, it can only transfer existing items.

-players/groups can create and share warehouses with each other.

-future requirement: the warehouse can be used as the supply-part for a shop where items can be bought or sold.

-requirement: players can only pick-up/drop-off items by interaction through chests.
It will not be possible to let the warehouse interact with the player's inventory directly because that is not realistic warehouse behaviour.

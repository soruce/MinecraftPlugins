The Warehouse plugin will implement the following functionality:

-mark chests to be part of a Warehouse by putting a sign on them.
The contents of the sign describe what items the chest will deliver from the supply pool.

-interact with the sign/chest in some way to refill the chests contents from the Warehouse.

-mark chest to be a dropoff point that players can use to offload items to the Warehouse, by putting them into the chest.

-requirement: the Warehouse can only deliver goods that were previously dropped off by players into the dropoff-chest.

-players/groups can create and share warehouses with each other.

-future requirement: the warehouse can be used as the supply-part for a shop where items can be bought or sold.
